Today I learned about the STAR project. 
* It is a valuable tool that can be used in various industries. It provides a structured approach to problem-solving and decision-making, which can lead to more efficient and effective outcomes.

I also learn how to create issues and milestones in my repository on Github.
* an issue is a feature that is used to track bugs, enhancements, or tasks that need to be completed within a repository. Issues can be created by anyone with access to a repository, and they can be used to discuss and collaborate on solutions to problems or ideas for improvements.
An issue can include a title, description, labels, assignees, and comments. These details can help to provide context and information about the issue and its progress.

* a milestone is a way to track progress on a group of related issues. A milestone is a collection of issues that are targeted to be completed by a specific date or within a specific timeframe. It can help to organize and prioritize work and provide a clear picture of progress towards a larger goal. Milestones can be used to group related issues together, and they can be assigned a due date or a specific release version. When an issue is assigned to a milestone, it can help to track the overall progress towards that milestone and provide a visual representation of the work that has been completed and what is left to be done.
