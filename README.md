## The process of hiring applicants involves several steps.

Firstly, applicants are required to sign up using a designated application link, such as http://apply.reveltek.com/.

Once the applicant has signed up, their information will be reviewed and listed. 

The next step is to send the applicant an email to inform them about the screening interview process. 
However, before scheduling the interview, it is important to clarify a few points with the applicant. 
Once these questions have been answered, a follow-up email should be sent, requesting the applicant to complete the attached test package and read the material provided. 

After this step, a screening interview can be scheduled using a calendar application such as MS Teams. The applicant should be invited to this meeting. 

After the screening interview has been conducted, all relevant information about the applicant should be indicated in Excel sheets for easy reference.

Today I learned about the STAR project. 
* It is a valuable tool that can be used in various industries. It provides a structured approach to problem-solving and decision-making, which can lead to more efficient and effective outcomes.

I also learn how to create issues and milestones in my repository on Github.
* an issue is a feature that is used to track bugs, enhancements, or tasks that need to be completed within a repository. Issues can be created by anyone with access to a repository, and they can be used to discuss and collaborate on solutions to problems or ideas for improvements.
An issue can include a title, description, labels, assignees, and comments. These details can help to provide context and information about the issue and its progress.

* a milestone is a way to track progress on a group of related issues. A milestone is a collection of issues that are targeted to be completed by a specific date or within a specific timeframe. It can help to organize and prioritize work and provide a clear picture of progress towards a larger goal. Milestones can be used to group related issues together, and they can be assigned a due date or a specific release version. When an issue is assigned to a milestone, it can help to track the overall progress towards that milestone and provide a visual representation of the work that has been completed and what is left to be done.
